### Next Auth

Next Auth is a library created for React that manages Authorization. The library creates a session that holds a next-auth token when logged in. On signout, this session is cleared. The keycloak token will still remain as a cookie until in expires. 

The sign in function redirects to keycloak through the [nextauth].js file.

The variables are:
`NEXT_PUBLIC_ISSUER=https://dev.loginproxy.gov.bc.ca/auth/realms/{realm}`
`NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_ID={resource}`
`NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_SECRET=anything_you_want:)`

If using a public client, the client secret still has to be defined.
